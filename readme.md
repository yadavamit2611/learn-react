#learning react by applying what I have learned.
Food delivery app -
1. used liferando's api to fetch data for displaying live restaurants details and their menus.
2. used react-router-dom for handling the routing and making the app work properly as a SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION.
3. Added location based search using an api to find the coordinates.
4. code optimization using lazy loading, separation of concern, code splitting and chunking.
5. added redux-toolkit and react-redux for efficient data management - handling the addition of food items and cart
6. used tailwindcss for adding css on the go - no more hassle of switching between codes in order to work on js and css simultaneously
7. used githubÂ´s user api to get my details and show in the about section
