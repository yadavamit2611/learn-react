package lock : locks the version for you
~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, 
will update you to all future patch versions,
 without incrementing the minor version.
  ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <1.3.0.

^version “Compatible with version”, 
will update you to all future minor/patch versions,
 without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases
  from 1.2.3 to <2.0.0.

  never keep package-lock.json in gitignore

   react has a thing called props which is 
like attributes but configurable with our own made attributes

minify,optimise,remove console.log, bundle, caching
 react is a library 
 we use bundlers to minify your app, optimize and remove console etc
bundlers are package or modules (javascript code)

 package-manager

 npm or yarn

 vite, parcel, webpack bundlers(read about bundlers)
 never add node modules into the github repositories

to install react and ReactDOM and keep these dependencies globally
npm i react
npm i ReactDOM

//Igniting your app
npx means execute using npm

npx parcel index.html
once you execute using parcel you will get your own server and this is all
because of parcel


// browser doesnt know what is import
so we need to tell that this app.js is not normal js file its a module
by adding the attribute type="module" to the script tag

//parcel does everything that looks magical to your application
including Hot Module Reload

parcel will keep a track of all the changes you make to all your files

concept: file watcher algorithm (parcel) - c++
which is used to figure out the pages in which changes took place

//dist file holds the minified files
to be used on servers
npx parcel index.html
does this for us, to make our application production build using build cmd

//Hot Module Reloading
//BUNDLING
//MINIFY
//NO CONSOLE LOGS - cleaning code
//Dev abd production build
//Super fast build algorithm
//Image optimization
//caching while development
//compressing
//compatible with older version of browser
//also gives us functionality to develop application for https
// it handles port numbers as well
//consistent hashing algorithm
//zero configuration bundle - you dont need to configure parcel just need to gives
entry point

*if react is narendra modi then parcel is amit shah

parcel does image optimization as well

+we should put parcel-cache in gitignore
everything that can be auto-generated should be added to gitignore because
it can be generated automcatically on the server using lock.json file


*parcel has transitive dependencies
Transitive dependencies 
our package manager which handles and takes care of transitive dependencies 
in our project

dependency tree
react , parcel (all the dependencies for making production ready application)
these dependencies are called transitive dependencies
